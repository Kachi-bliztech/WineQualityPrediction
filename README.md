<h1>Loan Eligibility Prediction System</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project Overview:
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. A wine manufacturing company is developing a new brand and aims to ensure high-quality standards by leveraging data-driven insights. The predictive model will support quality control during the production process.

Problem Statement:
The wine manufacturing company seeks to evaluate and optimize the quality of its new wine brand. The objective is to predict wine quality using various measurable features such as acidity, sugar content, pH level, and alcohol percentage. Accurate predictions will help the company maintain consistency, meet customer expectations, and minimize production flaws.

Model Approach:
- <b>Acquired wine quality dataset containing chemical attributes and corresponding quality ratings.</b>
- </b>Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationship of features with wine quality.</b>
- </b>Preprocessed the data: Preprocessed the data by a.Handling missing values b.Normalizing numerical features c.Encoding categorical variables (if any)</b>

Built and tested several machine learning model: </b>
- </b>Random Forest</b>



<h2>Skills </h2>

- <b>Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)</b>
- <b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b>
- <b>Randomforestclassifier</b>
- <b>Feature engineering</b>
- <b>Model evaluation and interpretation</b>

<h2>Outcomes </h2>

- <b>Successfully developed a predictive model capable of estimating wine quality based on input features. The solution enables the wine manufacturer to evaluate production batches more effectively and maintain high-quality standards, contributing to the success of the new wine brand in the market.</b>
